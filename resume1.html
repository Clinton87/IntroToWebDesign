        <p>I have started my coding journey with Codespace. I have learned what I can about HTML, CSS and Javascript on my own, but found that I needed more of a structure to fully understand it.</p>
        <p>Ever since the first moment I started the course I have learned something new or something I was previously familiar with has made more sense to me.</p>
        <p>I'm looking forward to the rest of the Frontend Developer course.</p>

        <h3>Cage Cashier</h3>
        <p>After receiving my Computer Engineering certificate, I looked for work to get practical experience, however I didn't find anything at the time. I did however find a job as a Cage Cashier at Grand West Casino and remained there for almost 5 years before moving on to a new challenge.</p>

        <p>When personal projects in PC Repair and Band Management did not come to fruition respectively, I started working at Amazon in Cape Town.
